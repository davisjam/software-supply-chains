"""LINT `figure-text-intrusion` — the text-flows-INTO-a-foreign-box SENSOR for the hand-authored house SVGs.

THE INVARIANT (the inverse of the overflow sibling). The overflow sensor catches a label spilling OUT of
its own frame. This one catches its mirror image: a label whose glyphs flow INTO a box that is not its own —
an edge label wedged into a gap too narrow for it, so its text lands on top of a neighbouring node's body
and collides with that node's label. The mage-method "changes the economics" edge label sitting across the
Commodity-intelligence box, and the gloss-core-ideas "expands the semantic surface for" label bleeding into
both principle boxes, are the motivating cases. Text flowing OUT of a box and text flowing INTO a foreign
box are the two halves of the same measurable defect: a label's readable rectangle landing where it should
not.

NOT the z-order sensor. The sibling `figure-text-occlusion` sensor asks a DOCUMENT-ORDER question — is an
opaque box painted AFTER a label it covers, hiding it? That fault is about paint order and legibility. This
sensor asks a GEOMETRY question that ignores paint order entirely: does a label's readable quad sit inside a
box it does not belong to? A perfectly legible label (painted last, on top) is still a defect if it is lying
across the wrong box. The two sensors are complementary; neither subsumes the other.

Which box is "foreign". A box's OWN label is centred in it — its quad's centre point falls inside the box.
An intruding edge label's centre falls OUTSIDE the box it bleeds into (in the gap, or over a neighbour). So
for each (label, box) pair the box is foreign iff the label quad's CENTRE is not inside it; only then can the
label's glyphs landing inside it be an intrusion rather than the box's own caption. The page-background rect
is never foreign — every label's centre lies inside it — so it never flags.

How it measures (reuses the occlusion sibling's vetted machinery — unify, don't re-derive):
  * Label quads + box polygons come from the occlusion sensor's `_Walker` (the per-glyph advance model from
    the overflow sensor; the affine-transform + path-flatten helpers from the label-collision sensor). Same
    opaque-fill test (effective alpha >= OPAQUE_ALPHA), same `<defs>` skip, same true-shape polygons.
  * Intrusion by sampling, not bounding boxes. A label's glyph quad is sampled on a grid; an intrusion fires
    when the label quad's centre is outside a box AND >= `MIN_COVER` of its samples fall inside that box's
    real polygon. Sampling the true shapes keeps a diamond's bbox from misfiring, exactly as in the sibling.

LANDING: BLOCKING. Landed audit-only, then a figure fix-wave drained the corpus to 0 (8 figures fixed; two
confirmed false positives — a label over a soft cluster FIELD, and a cylinder's own 2nd caption line whose
path+arc polygon under-covers — resolved by the backdrop-field and caption-cohesion refinements below), so
this gate now holds the tree at 0 alongside the overflow / occlusion siblings. Run:

    python3 book-models/lint_figure_text_intrusion.py            # print intrusions (audit view, exits 0)
    python3 book-models/lint_figure_text_intrusion.py --strict   # exit 1 on any intrusion (the future gate)
    python3 book-models/lint_figure_text_intrusion.py <file.svg> # check specific figure(s)
