"""LINT `figure-family-budget` — the figure colour-LANGUAGE consistency gate (a coarse projection of INV-SEM).

The figures have quietly grown a colour vocabulary: green = modeling, rust = governance, blue = agent,
gray = neutral, red = failure (the `figure_semantics` block in design-tokens.json). Readers start reading
the colours as meaning, so the colours must stay relentlessly consistent — a governance-rust element must
never leak into an all-green modeling figure.

A lint cannot check "this rect, which DEPICTS a model, is green" — an SVG `<rect fill="#1f7a4d"/>` carries
no role, so intent is unreadable. But it CAN check the coarser, still-real guarantee: which colour FAMILIES
a whole figure is allowed to use, declared once in a header marker the author writes:

    <!-- semantic-families: modeling, neutral -->

The lint then asserts every family-owned hex in that SVG belongs to a DECLARED family — i.e.
`family_of_hex(hex) ∈ declared ∪ {None}`. Supporting neutrals (ink/paper/rule) and non-family colours map
to None and are ignored here (the sibling design-token-drift lint holds palette MEMBERSHIP). So an accidental
agent-blue leaking into the all-green Representation Ladder is caught deterministically, at one comment per
figure — the "relentless consistency" cost is a single declaration, not a per-element annotation.

Findings (per SVG):
  1. UNDECLARED — the figure uses a family hex but declares NO `semantic-families` header at all (so nothing
     scopes its palette). Every figure that uses a role colour should declare its budget.
  2. OUT-OF-BUDGET — a family hex whose family is not in the figure's declared set (the leak this exists to
     catch).
  3. BAD-FAMILY — the header names a token that is not one of the five families (a typo guard).

LANDS AUDIT-ONLY-FIRST (the repo's blocking-lint landing discipline): the corpus predates the header
convention, so most figures are UNDECLARED today. It PRINTS its findings and exits 0, so it never reddens an
in-flight commit; a figure-wiring wave adds the `semantic-families` headers, drains this to 0, and a follow-up
flips `--strict` (exit 1 on any finding) — the audit->drain->promote move.

Scan root: book/assets/*.svg (the same root the design-token-drift lint scans). The 8 redrawn figures live
in book/_design/drafts/figures-redraw/ until the wiring wave promotes them; widen SCAN_DIRS then if needed.

Run `python3 book-models/lint_figure_family_budget.py` to see the findings (audit-only, exit 0).
