"""LINT `figure-edge-should-be-orthogonal` — a declared box-to-box edge should route orthogonally.

THE DEFECT CLASS. A curved or sloped connector between two boxes seats its arrowhead — and any mid-edge
glyph — at whatever angle its end tangent happens to hit the border. That angle is almost never the
border's perpendicular, so the head skims flat along the box edge and reads as landing *in* the node, not
*arriving at* it; a decision-gate glyph riding the diagonal tilts the same way. The dangling-edge sensor
proves an edge TOUCHES its nodes and (for a directed head) that the head points in; this one proves the
prior, stronger claim the house notation now defaults to: the ROUTE itself is orthogonal — a straight
horizontal/vertical segment when the two rects are axis-alignable, else a single right-angled elbow — so
heads and glyphs seat perpendicular by construction (the correct-by-construction fix the router applies).

WHAT IT FLAGS (declared edges only — `<!-- edge: SRC -> DST -->` / `.. -->`; un-annotated figures skipped):

  * **SLOPE-BETWEEN-ALIGNABLE.** The two rects share a vertical corridor (x-spans overlap and the boxes are
    stacked) or a horizontal corridor (y-spans overlap and the boxes sit side by side), yet the edge is drawn
    as a curve, a slope, or an elbow. It should be one straight axis-aligned segment.
  * **CURVE-SHOULD-ELBOW.** The rects are NOT axis-alignable (the edge must turn), yet it turns with a curve
    or a diagonal instead of a single right angle. It should be one orthogonal elbow.
  * **PARENT-SIDE-EXIT.** A downstream child edge whose SOURCE end leaves the parent on a PERPENDICULAR side
    (a left/right border in a top-down figure) rather than the flow border (the parent's bottom). This breaks
    the parent->child hierarchy read — even a clean ortho-elbow that side-exits trips it. The figure's flow
    axis is read from the dominant edge direction; the flow-exit router re-routes the edge out the parent's
    flow border. Fires independently of shape, so a side-exiting elbow that no other rule catches is still
    flagged (its guard against regression).
  * **HEAD-NOT-PERPENDICULAR.** A directed head whose end-travel is not perpendicular to the border it enters
    (the geometric residue when neither route case above already fired) — the head skims the border.

THE OPT-OUT. A figure whose edges are DELIBERATELY diagonal — a decision-tree whose branch labels ride the
slope, a one-to-many fan an elbow would clutter — carries a standalone `<!-- edge-grammar: keep-angles -->`
marker; this sensor skips it wholesale, exactly as the router and the dangling-edge angle check do.

THE FIX. `python3 book-models/lint_figure_dangling_edge.py --orthogonalize <file.svg>` re-routes every
eligible edge; render-and-look confirms; `keep-angles` opts out the genuine exceptions.

LANDING: AUDIT-ONLY. It prints the book-wide offender set and returns 0 from the shared validator; it does
not gate. A new geometric sensor over a hand-authored corpus earns its blocking flip only after a fix-wave
drains the corpus to zero, so it lands audit-only first per the repo's blocking-lint discipline.

  python3 book-models/lint_figure_edge_should_be_orthogonal.py            # print offenders (audit-only, exits 0)
  python3 book-models/lint_figure_edge_should_be_orthogonal.py --strict   # exit 1 on any finding (the flip)
  python3 book-models/lint_figure_edge_should_be_orthogonal.py <file.svg> # check specific figure(s)
